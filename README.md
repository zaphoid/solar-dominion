### 3.3 Map & Navigation

The game map is a true-to-scale 3D representation of the solar system. Players can view it from multiple perspectives:

- **System View:** Entire solar system with orbital paths
- **Region View:** Focused on a planetary system (e.g., Earth-Luna, Mars, Jupiter and moons)
- **Local View:** Detailed view of a single celestial body or habitat

Navigation involves calculating transfer windows, delta-v requirements, and travel times based on real orbital mechanics.

### 3.4 Resource Management

Resources fall into several categories:

- **Strategic Resources:** Rare metals, radioactives, specialized compounds
- **Infrastructure:** Habitats, factories, research facilities, spaceports
- **Human Resources:** Population with various specializations (engineers, scientists, etc.)

All resources must be physically transported between locations, creating complex logistical challenges.

### 3.5 Technology System

The technology tree is divided into several branches:

- **Propulsion:** From chemical rockets to fusion drives
- **Habitation:** Life support, radiation protection, artificial gravity
- **Industry:** Manufacturing efficiency, resource extraction, recycling
